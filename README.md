# 🌐 Web Development Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **Web Development Journey** repository! This is where I document my progress, projects, and hands-on learning as I dive into the world of web development. Each project here shows a new skill, tool, or concept I've been exploring. 🌱

## 📁 Project Structure

This repository is organized into three main folders:

### 1. 📝 HTML Files

This folder contains various HTML files from my practice sessions. Here, I’m working on building the backbone of web pages, learning the essentials of HTML tags, and playing around with different layouts.

### 2. 🐶 Tindog

**Description:** Tindog is a playful project—a “Tinder for dogs”! 🐕🐩 Made with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, it showcases profiles of adoptable dogs in a sleek, responsive design, just like a dating app.  
**Technologies Used:** HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

### 3. 🎲 Dice Game

**Description:** This dice game is a fun, two-player experience where two dice are rolled each time you refresh the page. The outcomes determine who wins (or if it’s a tie!). Great for practicing JavaScript basics and some DOM manipulation magic! ✨  
**Technologies Used:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
