# 🌐 Web Development Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **Web Development Journey** repository! This is where I document my progress, projects, and hands-on learning as I dive into the world of web development. Each project here shows a new skill, tool, or concept I've been exploring. 🌱

## 📁 Project Structure

This repository is organized into three main folders:

### 1. 📝 HTML Files

This folder contains various HTML files from my practice sessions. Here, I’m working on building the backbone of web pages, learning the essentials of HTML tags, and playing around with different layouts.

### 2. 🐶 Tindog

**Description:** Tindog is a playful project—a “Tinder for dogs”! 🐕🐩 Made with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, it showcases profiles of adoptable dogs in a sleek, responsive design, just like a dating app.  
**Technologies Used:** HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

### 3. 🎲 Dice Game

**Description:** This dice game is a fun, two-player experience where two dice are rolled each time you refresh the page. The outcomes determine who wins (or if it’s a tie!). Great for practicing JavaScript basics and some DOM manipulation magic! ✨  
**Technologies Used:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### 4. 🥁 Drum Kit

**Description:** Rock out with this interactive drum kit! Press the corresponding keys or click the buttons to play different drum sounds. A perfect project for practicing JavaScript event handling and adding audio elements to web applications. 🎵  
**Technologies Used:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### 5. 🎮 Simon Game

**Description:** Test your memory with this digital version of the classic Simon game! Follow the pattern of lights and sounds, and try to repeat it. The game gets progressively harder as you succeed. Built using jQuery for smooth animations and interactive gameplay. 🎯  
**Technologies Used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
